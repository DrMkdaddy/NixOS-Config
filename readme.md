Masochistic tedencies and an inability to have quality sleep habits birthed
this.

- `nasr`: My desktop PC turned kinda home server.
- `idris`: My laptop. I hate this thing.
- `global`: Where no-holds-bar configurations are stored.
- `shared`: Previously like `global` but is now just a place to keep the shared
  home.
- `specific`: The new `shared`; for specific set ups that reused among one or
  two machines.
